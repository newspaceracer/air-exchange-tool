# Ecology Spoke Template

The canonical starting point for a new **design-system spoke** of the ESA Ecology
hub. This directory is an **inert template**: its manifest is stored as
`package.json.tmpl` (not `package.json`) so the monorepo's `packages/*` workspace
glob ignores it and `npm install` never tries to build it. Files contain
`__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens that get substituted when the template is instantiated.

The `/spoke-init` command (from the **spoke-kit plugin**) orchestrates
instantiation, and the deterministic copy/rename/substitute work is a script —
`scripts/create-spoke.mjs` at the hub root. **Always scaffold via the script**;
hand-copying once silently dropped the `.claude/` dot-directory and the spoke
ran with no component-first enforcement. The manual steps below document what
the script does (and remain the fallback of last resort).

## What a spoke is

A spoke is a child of the **`@esa/ecology` hub** — its own Astro repo that:

1. depends on the hub packages,
2. ships a thin `theme-<slug>.css` of **semantic/component token overrides**
   (the brand layer — primitives never move), and
3. dogfoods the inherited `esa-*` components + builds project-specific prototypes
   on top of them.

The hub owns the design *standard* and the reference implementation; a spoke
re-skins it and adds its own catalog + prototypes. Patterns that prove broadly
useful get promoted back up to the hub.

## The 4-package contract

A spoke depends on four packages from the sibling `../ecology` checkout:

| Package | Dep type | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `@esa/tokens` | dependency | Primitives + default semantic tokens (`tokens.css`, `component-tokens.css`). |
| `@esa/ecology` | dependency | The `esa-*` components (`.astro` + Lit web components). |
| `@esa/docs` | dependency | The shared `DocsShell` + token-driven foundation components (`ColorFoundation`, `TypeFoundation`, …). |
| `@esa/handoff` | devDependency | Dev-mode handoff export (rendered prototype → de-scoped HTML/CSS bundle). |

Plus `astro` (dependency) and `gh-pages` (devDependency, for the GitHub Pages
deploy). All four `@esa/*` deps use `file:../ecology/packages/*` links, so the
spoke must live as a sibling of the `ecology` checkout.

## Placeholder legend

Substitute every occurrence of each token across every file (including the
`theme-smaqmd.css` filename itself):

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SMAQMD` | Display name (titles, brand chrome, prose) | `Beacon` |
| `smaqmd` | Lowercase id (`data-theme`, theme filename, DocsShell `theme` prop) | `beacon` |
| `air-exchange-tool` | Repo/dir name + GitHub Pages base | `beacon-design` |
| `smaqmd` | npm scope; package name becomes `@smaqmd/design`; raw token prefix `--smaqmd-*` | `beacon` |
| `S` | Short text mark for the sidebar | `B` |
| `<!-- TODO(spoke-init): add the brand's Google Fonts <link> tags -->` | Where the brand's Google Fonts `<link>` tags go | `<link href="…DM+Sans…" rel="stylesheet" />` |
| `Design system and prototypes for SMAQMD` | One-line description for the landing hero | `The brand language, patterns, and prototypes for the Beacon platform` |

## Token-driven foundations

The five **Foundations** pages (`color`, `typography`, `spacing`, `radius`,
`iconography`) are generic and ship ready to go — they render live from the
active theme via `@esa/docs` components. The only per-spoke edit is in
`color.astro`: pass this spoke's own primitive ramp(s) via the `ramps` prop (a
`TODO(spoke-init)` comment marks the spot).

## The component catalog is per-spoke

`src/data/ds-nav.ts` ships a **scaffold** `componentGroups` array with one example
entry (Button → `esa-button`), and `src/pages/design-system/components/` ships
exactly one page (`esa-button.astro`) demonstrating the `ComponentDoc` pattern.

Populate the rest per spoke:

- **If the source app has a catalog** (e.g. an Angular `ui-catalog`), mirror its
  sections and entries, mapping each `ui-*` component to its `@esa/ecology`
  `esa-*` equivalent.
- **Otherwise**, curate: list the `esa-*` components this spoke actually uses,
  grouped into sensible sections.

For each catalog entry, add a `NavItem` in `ds-nav.ts` **and** a sibling page
under `src/pages/design-system/components/<slug>.astro` (copy `esa-button.astro`
as the template).

## Instantiating

Preferred (deterministic — run from the hub root):

```bash
node scripts/create-spoke.mjs --name "Beacon" --slug beacon --dir beacon-design \
  --scope beacon --mark B --tagline "..."
```

Then continue with steps 5–9 below (the judgment work `/spoke-init` walks).

By hand (fallback only):

1. Copy this directory to a new sibling of `../ecology`, named `air-exchange-tool`
   (e.g. `../beacon-design`). **Include dotfiles** — `.claude/settings.json`
   declares the spoke-kit plugin (skills + enforcement hook); without it the
   spoke runs with no intelligence layer.
2. Rename `package.json.tmpl` → `package.json`.
3. Rename `src/styles/theme-smaqmd.css` → `theme-<slug>.css`.
4. Find-and-replace every placeholder from the legend above across all files.
5. Insert the brand's Google Fonts `<link>` tags at `<!-- TODO(spoke-init): add the brand's Google Fonts <link> tags -->` in
   `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` and `src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro`.
6. Fill in `src/styles/theme-<slug>.css` — work through sections (1)–(7),
   replacing each `/* __FILL__ */` marker and placeholder value. Reference
   `../beacon-design/src/styles/theme-beacon.css` as a worked example.
7. Populate `src/data/ds-nav.ts` `componentGroups` + add the matching
   `src/pages/design-system/components/*.astro` pages (see "catalog" above).
8. Pass the spoke's primitive ramp(s) into `color.astro` via `ramps`.
9. `npm install && npm run dev` to verify, then build prototypes.

`create-spoke.mjs` performs steps 1–4 deterministically; `/spoke-init` runs the
script and then walks 5–9 (drafting 6–8 from the source app's tokens/catalog
where one exists, with human review). It finishes with the definition-of-done
checklist — including the intelligence-layer checks.
